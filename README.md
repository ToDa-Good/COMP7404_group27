1.for the code in resnet_improvement.py 

Line1-11 (by ourselves) 

Line32-56 original resnet(we make some modify from https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42437114/article/details/106996019)

Line58-182  (by ourselvesï¼› we add the improvement part according to the Mathematical principle and use class BasicBlock(nn.Module) as templete)

Line262-320 training and testing part (by ourselves)



2.for the workload of our group presentation

all of our teammates write the code and get familiar with mathematical principles

(a)one student (1)organize information about introduction part and mathmatical theory part

               (3)finish ppt of this part
               
(b)one student (1)organize information about related work part and method part
               (2)draw a flowchart about our code

(c)one student (1)organize information about experiment part
               (2)analysis the result of the training and testing of our code
